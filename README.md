## Quick Start

1. **Open `index.html`** in your web browser
2. Paste text into the input area
3. Click "Analyze"
4. Hover over highlighted or underlined terms to see their meanings

That's it! No installation, no cookies, no server, no dependencies, no LLMs

## Datasets

**Coded Term Database**:
- Curated list of coded language

**Harmful Term Database** 
- Curated list of harmful and hateful language

**Place-Demonym Lookup**:
- Curated list of places and demonyms

**Religionym Lookup**:
- Curated list of religionyms

## Features Implemented

✅ **Dual Detection System**
- Coded language - background color highlights
- Harmful terms (explicit language) - colored underlines
- Clear visual distinction between the two types

✅ **Advanced Pattern Matching**
- Obfuscation detection (leet speak, character substitution, accented characters)
- Plural matching
- Whitespace variation handling ("soyboy", "soy-boy", "soy boy")
- Root term matching with variation support

✅ **Populist Language Detection**
- Template-based pattern matching for place-based coded language
- Automatically generates demonyms (America → American, Americans)
- Detects global variations of nationalist expressions
- Examples detected:
  - "America First" pattern matches "Britain First", "India First", etc.
  - "Make America Great Again" matches "Make Liverpool Great Again", "Make Scotland Great Again"
  - "hard-working Americans" matches "hard-working Indians", "hard-working Scots"
- Intelligent categorization: Countries → Nationalist, Regions/Cities → Localist
- Ensures the tool works globally, not just for American-centric expressions

✅ **Interactive UI**
- Category-specific color coding (18 different categories)
- Hover tooltips with detailed information
- Smart tooltip positioning (stays within viewport)

✅ **Statistics & Scoring**
- Terms flagged count with type breakdown
- Category distribution display
- Signal score (0-100%) with severity indicator
- Interactive score breakdown tooltip showing calculation details
- Proper pluralization in all displays

✅ **Technical Excellence**
- 100% client-side processing (privacy-first)
- Zero dependencies, no build process
- DRY code architecture with shared utilities
- Theme configuration for easy customization
- Responsive design (desktop and mobile)

✅ **Proper Attribution**
- Silent Signals dataset citation
- GoodBoy database documentation

## Features Pending / In Progress

⏳ **Analytics Tracking** - Metrics defined but not yet implemented (privacy-first approach)
⏳ **Harmful Term Database Expansion** - Currently in active development

## Technical Details

### Pattern Matching Architecture
- **Triple Matcher System**: Separate classes for coded terms, harmful terms, and pattern-based detection
  - `CodedTermMatcher`: Coded language from Silent Signals dataset
  - `HarmfulTermMatcher`: Explicit hateful language from curated database
  - `PatternMatcher`: Template-based detection for populist variations
- **Shared Obfuscation Utils**: DRY principle with single source of truth
- **Category Hierarchy System**: Centralized category configuration
  - 8 main categories with numerous subcategories
  - Hierarchical structure: main categories (for highlight colors) and subcategories (for detailed classification)

### Obfuscation Detection
Prevents evasion through multiple techniques:
- **Character Substitution (Leet Speak)**: Detects "$oyboy", "f@g", "cukk", "s0yboy" with comprehensive character mappings
- **Accented Characters**: Catches "søyboy", "sōyboy", "cūck", unicode variants
- **Whitespace Variations**: Matches "soyboy", "soy-boy", "soy_boy", "soy boy", "#soyboy"
- **Punctuation Normalization**: Removes redundant variations while preserving meaning
- **Plural Forms**: Automatically adds optional 's' to all patterns
- **Unicode Normalization**: Uses NFC normalization to ensure consistent character encoding

### Text Substitution
Creates matches without requiring an enormous database
- **Word Substitution**: Slang, eye dialect, meme speech, ordinal numbers, contractions and UK spellings
- **Suffix Substitution**: Bidirectional UK and US suffix handling

### Signal Scoring Algorithm
Calculates 0-100% score based on three factors:
- **Match Density**: Percentage of words that are problematic
- **Match Type Weight**: Harmful an coded terms are weighted
- **Category Diversity**: Diversity of problematic categories

### Performance
- Databases: ~ 400KB (compresses well with gzip)
- Load time: Instant on modern browsers
- Analysis time: Near-instant for typical text lengths
- Memory usage: Minimal (~2-3 MB)

### Browser Compatibility
- Chrome/Edge: ✅
- Firefox: ✅
- Safari: ✅
- Mobile browsers: ✅
- IE11: ❌ (not supported, uses modern JS)

## Privacy

- **No tracking currently implemented**
- **No cookies**
- **No external requests** (except for future optional analytics)
- **No data storage** (all processing is ephemeral)
- **All analysis happens locally** in your browser

## Roadmap

We are currently in Phase 1: Proof of concept
- Phase 2: URL Analysis (analyze entire webpages)
- Phase 3: Browser Extension
- Phase 4: Crowdsourced Database Expansion
- Phase 5: Logical Fallacy Detection
- Phase 6: Platform Analysis Tools

## Contributing

This is currently in proof-of-concept phase. Future contributions welcome for:
- Signal scoring algorithm design
- Analytics implementation
- UI/UX improvements
- Database expansion

## Support

GoodBoy will always be free
- Donations welcome: https://ko-fi.com/nautiluszaibatsu
Future funding through:
- Grants (digital democracy, media literacy orgs)
- NGO partnerships
- Foundation sponsorships (Mozilla, EFF, etc.)
